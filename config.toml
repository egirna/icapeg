#"Reading from env variable if value is not in toml file feature"
#feature is supported for strings, int, bool, time.duration and string slices only
#(every type used in this project)

#to use this feature you have to do the next
#assume that there is an env variable called LOG_LEVEL and you want to assign LOG_LEVEL value to app.log_level
#You will change the value of (log_level= "debug") to (log_level= "$_LOG_LEVEL")

#If you want to add an array as an env variable in your machine, please add backslash before special characters
#like white spaces, double quotes and comas, example:
#export ARRAY= "[\"txt\", \"pdf\", \"dmg\", \"exe\", \"com\", \"rar\", \"unknown\"]"
#Don't forget to put the value between double quotes in case there are white spaces in the value.

#NOTE: before you use this feature please make sure that the env variable that you want to use is globally in
# your machine and not just exported in a local session
